This is a basic user-registration application for Django,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
requires a functional installation of Django 1.8 or newer, but has no
other dependencies.

Full documentation is `available online
<https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/>`_.

.. admonition::

   django-registration's latest release is 2.4.1. It is currently
   undergoing major codebase changes for the next release, which will
   be 3.0. If you want to run from a git checkout rather than the
   latest released package (and doing so is not recommended), you
   should use the ``2.x`` branch, as ``master`` is likely to be
   extremely unstable.
